## What is This?

This is the official **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for PatSnap's **Chemical Molecular**.

It empowers AI agents with deep chemistry knowledge, allowing them to search for **structures**, **analyze synthetic pathways**, and investigate the **chemical IP landscape** with professional-grade accuracy.

Perfect for medicinal chemists, process engineers, and IP professionals who need an AI agent that truly "understands" chemistry.
