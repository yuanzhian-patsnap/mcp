## What is This?

This is the official **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for PatSnap's **Pharma Intelligence** platform. It gives AI agents direct, structured access to PatSnap's proprietary life sciences database — enabling agents to reason over real pharmaceutical data rather than relying on static training knowledge.

Built for researchers, drug developers, competitive intelligence teams, and anyone who needs a **professionally-trained AI agent** that can navigate the complexity of modern biomedical R&D.
