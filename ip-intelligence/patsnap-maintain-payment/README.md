## Product Definition

PatSnap Maintain Payment MCP is a Model Context Protocol server that connects AI agents to PatSnap's Maintain Payment capabilities. A global patent search tool for freedom-to-operate assessment. It supports query-based, semantic, and image search, and can be combined with patent family, legal status, and analytics views to help users identify patents that may create FTO barriers more systematically. It is suitable for pre-launch assessment, R&D route selection, and legal support.
