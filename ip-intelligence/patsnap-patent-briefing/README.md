## Product Definition

PatSnap Patent Briefing MCP is a Model Context Protocol server that connects AI agents to PatSnap's Patent Briefing capabilities. A quick-read tool for understanding a patent or patent family. It brings together bibliographic data, legal status, family information, the three core technical elements, drawings, and translations of specifications, abstracts, and claims so that even users without a patent background can grasp the key points quickly. It is useful for internal communication, early screening, patent training, and client briefings.
